# How do we work in Node without Mongoose?

## What we will cover

- What is an ORM?
- Can we live without one?
- How do we structure our code to make it testable?

## Notes

Request:

> Would you like to go over how'd you design a simple REST API (fp or oop doesn't matter) without using mongoose or an ORM? Just raw SQL with queries. How would you design a service? How would you test it? Cheers
